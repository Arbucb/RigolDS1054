# RigolDS1054
Code to pull data from a RigolDS1054.  The scaling is always a challenge depending on your settings and Rigol.  Also, this version references @ni and requires installation of the national instruments library to work.  There are other solutions out there if you wanted to play as NI is a large install (at least as I found it) and also became a system headache.
